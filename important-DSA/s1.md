To solve the problem of determining the maximum number of chunks into which an array can be split so that sorting each chunk individually results in a fully sorted array upon concatenation, we can utilize a Python solution that leverages the properties of permutations and cumulative maximum values.

**Python Solution:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        max_so_far = -1
        chunks = 0
        for i, value in enumerate(arr):
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, value)
            if max_so_far == i:
                chunks += 1
        return chunks
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_so_far` is initialized to `-1`. This variable keeps track of the maximum value encountered in the array up to the current index.
   - `chunks` is initialized to `0`. This variable counts the number of valid chunks.

2. **Iteration through the array:**
   - We iterate over the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value at that index `value`.

3. **Updating the maximum value:**
   - For each element, we update `max_so_far` to be the maximum of the current `max_so_far` and the current `value`.

4. **Checking for chunk boundaries:**
   - We check if `max_so_far` is equal to the current index `i`. If this condition is true, it indicates that all elements from the start of the current chunk up to the current index are less than or equal to `i`, meaning they can form a valid chunk that, when sorted, will be in the correct position in the fully sorted array.
   - When this condition is met, we increment the `chunks` counter by `1`.

5. **Returning the result:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, we return the value of `chunks`, which represents the maximum number of chunks into which the array can be split to achieve the desired sorting property.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Let's consider the example `arr = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]`:

- **Index 0:**
  - `value = 1`
  - `max_so_far = max(-1, 1) = 1`
  - `max_so_far (1) != index (0)`, so `chunks` remains `0`.

- **Index 1:**
  - `value = 0`
  - `max_so_far = max(1, 0) = 1`
  - `max_so_far (1) == index (1)`, so we increment `chunks` to `1`.

- **Index 2:**
  - `value = 2`
  - `max_so_far = max(1, 2) = 2`
  - `max_so_far (2) == index (2)`, so we increment `chunks` to `2`.

- **Index 3:**
  - `value = 3`
  - `max_so_far = max(2, 3) = 3`
  - `max_so_far (3) == index (3)`, so we increment `chunks` to `3`.

- **Index 4:**
  - `value = 4`
  - `max_so_far = max(3, 4) = 4`
  - `max_so_far (4) == index (4)`, so we increment `chunks` to `4`.

After processing all elements, the total number of chunks is `4`.

**Conclusion:**

This approach efficiently determines the maximum number of chunks by maintaining a running maximum and comparing it to the current index, ensuring that each chunk can be sorted independently to contribute to the fully sorted array. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is O(1), making it both time and space efficient.
