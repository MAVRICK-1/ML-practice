Let's break down the line **`repl = counts[counts <= threshold].index`** in detail.

### Key Concepts

1. **`counts`**  
   - This is a **Pandas Series** where:
     - The **index** represents the unique values in the `'brand'` column (e.g., brand names).
     - The **values** represent the count (frequency) of each brand.

   Example of `counts`:
   ```python
   counts = pd.Series({
       'Nike': 150,
       'Puma': 80,
       'Adidas': 50,
       'Reebok': 40
   })
   # Output:
   # Nike      150
   # Puma       80
   # Adidas     50
   # Reebok     40
   ```

2. **`counts <= threshold`**  
   - This creates a **Boolean mask** by comparing the values in `counts` to the `threshold` (100).  
   - For each value in `counts`, it checks whether the value is **less than or equal to 100**.

   Example:
   ```python
   threshold = 100
   counts <= threshold
   # Output:
   # Nike      False  (150 > 100)
   # Puma       True  (80 <= 100)
   # Adidas     True  (50 <= 100)
   # Reebok     True  (40 <= 100)
   ```

3. **`counts[counts <= threshold]`**  
   - Using the Boolean mask, it **filters** the `counts` Series to include only the brands where the condition is `True`.

   Example:
   ```python
   counts[counts <= threshold]
   # Output:
   # Puma      80
   # Adidas    50
   # Reebok    40
   ```

4. **`.index`**  
   - `.index` extracts the **index** of the filtered `counts` Series.  
   - Since the index of `counts` represents the brand names, this will give you a list of brands that meet the condition.

   Example:
   ```python
   counts[counts <= threshold].index
   # Output:
   # Index(['Puma', 'Adidas', 'Reebok'], dtype='object')
   ```

---

### Final Result
- **`repl`** now contains the brand names (as an Index object) where the counts are **less than or equal to the threshold** (100).

Example:
```python
threshold = 100
repl = counts[counts <= threshold].index
print(repl)
# Output:
# Index(['Puma', 'Adidas', 'Reebok'], dtype='object')
```

---

### Why Use This?
The variable `repl` is typically used to:
- Identify rare or low-frequency values (brands in this case).
- Replace or group them into a single category like `'Other'`.

For example:
```python
df['brand'] = df['brand'].replace(repl, 'Other')
```
This replaces all brands in `repl` (low-frequency brands) with the value `'Other'`.
